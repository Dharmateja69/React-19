What Is Store?
A store is a central place where the state of
our application is stored & it can be created
using the ConfigureStore function, and it holds
the entire state tree of our application.


What Is Slice?
A slice is a piece of store state and  the corresponding
reducer logic to update that state. Slices are a way to
organize our Redux store by breaking it down into
smaller, more manageable parts.

Slices Analogy
Imagine you have a big cake, and you want to cut it into
smaller, more manageable pieces. Each smaller piece is
like a "slice" of the cake. In the context redux toolkit a
"slice" is like a smaller part of your application's overall
state and the instructions on how to change or update
that specific part.


initialState:
============
InitialState as the name suggest is going to be the "initial"
data of our state.

Reducers:
• Reducers are like the instructions on what to do with
each slice of the cake.
• They define how the information in a particular slice
can.

Actions
• Actions are like the requests or command you give
to change a specific slice of the cake.
• For example, you might have an action called "Eat a
Bite" that instructs how to take a bite from a slice.

useSelector() Hook
useSelector hook allows us to read data from the
redux store.

useDispatch() Hook
The dispatch function is used to send actions to the
store, triggering updates to the application state.
In simpler terms, it lets you change the state in your
Redux store from within your React components.

Redux Toolkit Query
Redux Toolkit Query ( RTK ) is specifically designed to simplify data fetching
caching, and state management
for API calls in a React and Redux application.
