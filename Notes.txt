COMPILER
React 19 now includes its own compiler, which will not only
speed up performance but also automate certain tedious
tasks, reducing the workload for developers.

Memorization
With React 19's new compiler, there's no longer a need for
memorization the process of optimizing components to
prevent unnecessary re-renders. Previously, we relied on
hooks like 'useMemo()' and 'useCaIIback() for this
purpose, but these will now become obsolete.


Metadata
We no longer need to install third-party packages for SEO and
metadata because React 19 now offers built-in support for these
features. We can place the tags anywhere within the component
and it will work for both the client and server.

Directives
React 19 now includes built-in support for use client and use
server directives.
This allows components to be rendered on the server,
resulting in improved SEO, faster page load times, and more
straightforward data fetching.

USE
The use() hook lets you read and load resources
asynchronously, such as promises or context. Unlike other
hooks, it can be utilized in loops and conditionals.
In certain situations, it can serve as a replacement for
useEffect() when fetching data, and it streamlines context
usage by allowing you to use use(context) instead of
useContext(contex).

ACTIONS
React 19 introduces Actions, which are asynchronous
functions designed to simplify form submissions. Actions
can be utilized on both the client and server sides.


useFormStatus
useFormStatus is a Hook that gives you status
information of the last form submission.
syntax:
const { pending, data, method, action } = useFormStatus();


useActionState is a Hook that allows you to update
state based on the result of a form action.
syntax:
const [state, formAction] = useActionState(fn, initialState);

In React 19, useTransition is a hook that helps manage state updates that might take time, like switching between UI views. It marks updates as low-priority, allowing React to keep the app responsive by showing the existing UI until the update is ready.
syntax:
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();


Part-2
======
Framer Motion is a popular open-source library for React.js
that allows developers to create animations and transitions
easily. It provides a set of tools and APIs to animate
components, enabling smooth, high-performance
animations with minimal effort.

prototypes and interactive designs.

Framer Motion
A library specifically for React that enables developers
to create smooth animations and transitions.

CSS Animations Pros
===================
Great for simple hover effects, transitions between states,
or animations that don't require complex logic.

CSS animations are typically very performant and can
leverage GPU acceleration.

No need for additional libraries, so your bundle size
remains smaller.

CSS Animations Cons
====================
More challenging to manage complex animations, such as
coordinating multiple elements or responding to user
interactions beyond simple events.

Animating properties based on component state can be
cumbersome.

Framer Motion Pros
==================
Offers advanced capabilities like drag, gestures, and
layout animations, which can be hard to achieve with pure
CSS.

Integrates seamlessly with React's component model,
allowing for easy management of state-driven animations.

Makes it easy to define and switch between different
animation states.

Framer Motion Cons
==================
Might take some time to get familiar with its API if you're
new to it.

Adds extra weight to your application compared to using
just CSS.

framer-motion
=============
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

motion is an object that provides a set of components and
hooks for creating animations and transitions in React
applications.

motion:
=======
When we use <motion.element> we're indicating that we
want to animate that specific <element>. Framer Motion
then provides additional props and features to facilitate
those animations, such as initial, animate, and exit,
allowing for more powerful and customizable animations.

Initial Prop:
=============
The initial prop is used to define the initial state of an
animated component before it enters the DOM, it specify
how the element should appear when it first renders.

Animate Prop:
=============
The animate prop is used to create animations for a
component. It lets you set target values for different CSS
properties, making it easy to have smooth changes when
the component's state updates.

Exit Prop:
==========
Exit prop is used to define the animation that occurs when
a component is removed from the React tree. This is
particularly useful for creating smooth transitions when
elements are unmounted/removed, enhancing the user
experience by visually indicating that something has
disappeared.

Transformations:
================
Transformations allow you to change the shape, size, and
position of elements on a webpage.

Transitions:
===========
Transitions are the effects that control how animations
happen. Think of them as the "rules" for how an element
moves or changes.

Transitions Properties:
======================
Duration:How long the animation takes.
Easing: The speed curve of the animation.
Delay: How long to wait before starting the animation.

  <motion.div
        className="box"
        initial={{ x: 0 }}
        animate={{ x: 200 }}
        // transition={{ delay: 2 }}
        // transition={{ delay: 5 }}
        // transition={{ duration: 1 }}
        transition={{ duration: 2, ease: "linear" }}
      />

Keyframes:
===========
keyframes allow us to create more complex animations by
specifying multiple points in an animation sequence.
Instead of just animating from one state to another, we
can define several intermediate states (frames) to control
the animation more precisely.
In simple : Splitting / Diving Animation
Into Multiple Frames.
