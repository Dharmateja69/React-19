COMPILER
React 19 now includes its own compiler, which will not only
speed up performance but also automate certain tedious
tasks, reducing the workload for developers.

Memorization
With React 19's new compiler, there's no longer a need for
memorization the process of optimizing components to
prevent unnecessary re-renders. Previously, we relied on
hooks like 'useMemo()' and 'useCaIIback() for this
purpose, but these will now become obsolete.


Metadata
We no longer need to install third-party packages for SEO and
metadata because React 19 now offers built-in support for these
features. We can place the tags anywhere within the component
and it will work for both the client and server.

Directives
React 19 now includes built-in support for use client and use
server directives.
This allows components to be rendered on the server,
resulting in improved SEO, faster page load times, and more
straightforward data fetching.

USE
The use() hook lets you read and load resources
asynchronously, such as promises or context. Unlike other
hooks, it can be utilized in loops and conditionals.
In certain situations, it can serve as a replacement for
useEffect() when fetching data, and it streamlines context
usage by allowing you to use use(context) instead of
useContext(contex).

ACTIONS
React 19 introduces Actions, which are asynchronous
functions designed to simplify form submissions. Actions
can be utilized on both the client and server sides.


useFormStatus
useFormStatus is a Hook that gives you status
information of the last form submission.
syntax:
const { pending, data, method, action } = useFormStatus();


useActionState is a Hook that allows you to update
state based on the result of a form action.
syntax:
const [state, formAction] = useActionState(fn, initialState);

In React 19, useTransition is a hook that helps manage state updates that might take time, like switching between UI views. It marks updates as low-priority, allowing React to keep the app responsive by showing the existing UI until the update is ready.
syntax:
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
